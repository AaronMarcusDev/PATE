## What is PATE?
PATE is a cross-platform terminal emulator made to help you in getting tasks done rather then remembering commands for every operating system.

## How do I use PATE?
PATE is a command line application, so you will need to open a terminal to use it. You can use the command `pate` to open PATE.

## How do I install PATE?
PATE is currently in development, so there is no way to install it yet. However, you can download the source code and compile it yourself.

## How do I compile PATE?
PATE is written in [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/), so you will need to install it to compile PATE. You can download it [here](https://www.freepascal.org/download.var). Once you have installed Free Pascal, you can compile PATE by running the command `fpc pate.pas` in the directory where you downloaded PATE.
